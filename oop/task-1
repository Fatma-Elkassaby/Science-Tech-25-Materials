Expanded System Requirements: Vehicle Management System
1. Basic Driving Behavior (Drivable)
•	All vehicles in the system must support basic driving actions:
o	Starting the vehicle.
o	Stopping the vehicle.
o	Accelerating the vehicle.
•	These actions should be standardized across all vehicle types.
2. Upgradeable Vehicles
•	Some vehicles support additional functionality for upgrading their engines.
•	Vehicles that are upgradeable must provide a method to upgrade their engine.
•	Upgradeable vehicles must also support all basic driving behaviors.
3. Vehicle Information
•	Every vehicle must provide a way to display its information (e.g., model name, type).
•	The information display should be customizable for each vehicle type.
4. Vehicle Types
•	The system should support at least two types of vehicles:
o	Cars:
	Cars have a model name and support all basic driving behaviors.
	Cars are upgradeable and can have their engines upgraded.
o	Bikes:
	Bikes have a model name and support all basic driving behaviors.
	Bikes are upgradeable and can have their engines upgraded.
5. Common Functionality
•	All vehicles share some common functionality, such as starting and stopping, which should be implemented once and reused across all vehicle types.
6. Extensibility
•	The system should be designed in a way that makes it easy to add new vehicle types in the future.
•	New vehicle types should be able to support basic driving behaviors and, optionally, upgrade functionality.
7. Testing the System
•	The system should include a way to demonstrate the functionality of all vehicles:
o	Start, accelerate, and stop each vehicle.
o	Upgrade the engine of upgradeable vehicles.
o	Display information about each vehicle.
